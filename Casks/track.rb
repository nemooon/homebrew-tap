  caveats <<~EOS
    Track is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, so macOS may quarantine it
    and refuse to open it. Remove the quarantine flag before first launch:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Track.app"

    Alternatively, try to open the app, then go to System Settings >
    Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway" under Security.
